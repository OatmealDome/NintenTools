# NintenTools

C# Framework to load Nintendo file formats into an object-oriented hierarchy, closely trying to resemble what the original Nintendo tools might have provided to compile the files.

Most specifically, the BFRES file format is focussed, based on the documentation of the Custom Mario Kart 8 Wiki.

The upcoming release features loading of the BFRES file, while saving functionality will be added later (at least in limited ways, as some parts are not yet fully reversed to allow completely new BFRES files from scratch).
