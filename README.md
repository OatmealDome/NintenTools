# NintenTools

This is a collection of .NET libraries and tools to handle typical Nintendo file formats, wrapping them in object oriented libraries and add-ons for programs to handle them, closely trying to resemble what the original Nintendo tools might have provided to create the files.

Most specifically, the BFRES file format is focused, based on the documentation of the Custom Mario Kart 8 Wiki and own research.

Usage
=====

Right now, the following usage cases are possible:
- Load and inspect the structure of BFRES files.
- Decompress Yaz0 files.
- C# "Test" tool: Validates BFRES with researched details. It prints any assumptions not met as a warning.

Contributing
============

Right now, the library is not under active development as I focus the Blender add-on first. I will probably rewrite big parts of the C# library in the future.

You're welcome to contribute. Let it be just raw BFRES file information which I implement then, or offer your own pull requests.

About code style: All Microsoft C# guidelines, max. line width of 120 characters. For C#, document everything except private stuff (it's nice to add research notes to some basic documentation later on).
