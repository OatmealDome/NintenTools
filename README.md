# NintenTools

.NET Framework written in C# to load Nintendo file formats into an object-oriented hierarchy, closely trying to resemble what the original Nintendo tools might have provided to create the files.

Most specifically, the BFRES file format is focused, based on the documentation of the Custom Mario Kart 8 Wiki and own research.

Usage
=====

Right now, the following usage cases are possible:
- Use it as a managed .NET 4.5 library to load and inspect BFRES files. Add the assembly to your references, and start programming with it.
- The "Test" tool validates BFRES at the moment and if any researched details meet what is seen in the wild. It prints any assumptions not met as a warning.

Contributing
============

You're welcome to contribute. Let it be just raw BFRES file information which I implement then, or offer your own pull requests.

Expect some bigger code shifting to happen in the future, especially when I implement modification / saving of some file formats, so don't rely on a solid code foundation yet.

About code style: All Microsoft C# guidelines, max. line width of 120 characters, document everything except private stuff (it's nice to add research notes to some basic documentation later on).
